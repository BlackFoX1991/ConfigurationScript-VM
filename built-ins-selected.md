## Built-ins (selected)

Common built-ins include `print`, `str`, numeric conversions, `len`, random utilities, etc.

```cfs
print("score=" + str(123));
print(abs(-5));          # 5
print(len([1,2,3]));     # 3   (works for arrays/strings/dicts)
```

> You can prefer the **method style** as well:  
> `arr.len()`, `strVal.len()`, `dict.len()`.
